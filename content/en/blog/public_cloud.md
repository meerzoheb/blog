## What is Public Cloud?

Public cloud is a type of cloud computing service that allows users to access computing resources, such as servers, storage, and applications, over the internet. These resources are provided by a third-party service provider who manages and maintains the infrastructure required to host and deliver them.

Public cloud services are typically delivered through a pay-per-use model, where users are charged based on their consumption of the resources they use. This allows organizations to scale up or down their usage of computing resources as needed, without having to invest in and manage their own IT infrastructure.

## Examples of public cloud services include:

**Amazon Web Services (AWS):** AWS is one of the largest public cloud providers in the world, offering a wide range of services such as computing, storage, databases, and networking.

Microsoft Azure: Azure is a cloud computing service offered by Microsoft that provides computing, storage, and networking services, as well as tools for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications.

**Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** GCP is a suite of cloud computing services offered by Google that provides infrastructure, platform, and application services, as well as machine learning and analytics tools.

**IBM Cloud:** IBM Cloud is a public cloud service that offers a range of services, including computing, storage, and networking, as well as tools for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications.

**Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI):** OCI is a public cloud service offered by Oracle that provides infrastructure, platform, and application services, as well as tools for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications.

In summary, public cloud is a type of cloud computing service that allows users to access computing resources over the internet, provided by a third-party service provider. This model provides scalability and cost-efficiency for organizations, making it a popular choice for many businesses today.
