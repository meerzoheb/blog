## What is Hybid Cloud?

Hybrid cloud is a type of cloud computing model that combines both public and private cloud services to create a single, integrated infrastructure. This allows organizations to leverage the benefits of both public and private cloud services while addressing any limitations or challenges associated with each.

In a hybrid cloud model, some applications and data are hosted in a private cloud, while others are hosted in a public cloud. The private cloud provides greater control over resources and data, while the public cloud offers scalability and flexibility.

## Examples of hybrid cloud services include:

**Amazon Web Services (AWS) Outposts:** AWS Outposts is a hybrid cloud service that allows organizations to run AWS services on-premises. This enables organizations to run certain applications and workloads locally while still being able to leverage the scalability and flexibility of AWS services.

**Microsoft Azure Hybrid Benefit:** The Azure Hybrid Benefit is a program that allows organizations to use their existing licenses for Windows Server or SQL Server to run those services in the cloud. This provides a cost-effective way to move applications to the cloud while still maintaining control over the infrastructure.

**Google Anthos:** Google Anthos is a hybrid cloud platform that allows organizations to manage applications across both on-premises and cloud environments. It provides a consistent development and deployment experience across different environments, enabling organizations to move workloads between environments as needed.

**IBM Cloud Satellite:** IBM Cloud Satellite is a hybrid cloud service that allows organizations to run applications in any cloud environment, including private, public, and edge environments. It provides a consistent experience for managing applications and data across different environments.

**VMware Cloud on AWS:** VMware Cloud on AWS is a hybrid cloud service that allows organizations to run their VMware workloads on AWS infrastructure. This enables organizations to leverage the scalability and flexibility of AWS while still using the tools and processes they are familiar with in their on-premises environments.

In summary, hybrid cloud is a type of cloud computing model that combines both public and private cloud services to create a single, integrated infrastructure. This model provides organizations with greater flexibility and control over their computing resources while also enabling them to leverage the scalability and cost-effectiveness of public cloud services.
